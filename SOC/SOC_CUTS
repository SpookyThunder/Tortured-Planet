is indeed back...the alien planet to

resources and a race of advanced aliens
who proved tragically easy to enslave. The

SceneText = The vacation is over! Sonic and his friends
are going to have to search Sunshine Atoll
Zone from top to bottom in search of
Eggman, all the while dismantling his army
of Crawlas. There aren't a lot of natural
hazards in this tropical paradise, but it's
easy to get lost once you stray from the
tourist paths. Eggman is waiting somewhere
in the jungle...

more trouble brewing! It seems that Eggman
is harnessing the energy of a magma hot
spot to power his factory. But this has
awakened a naturally dormant volcano which
is now spewing lava over a once-beautiful
plain! Sonic will have to shut down the
factory to save as much of the countryside
as he can.

in on the ruins of Eggman's former center of
operations, Dark City Zone. But Eggman is
not pleased that he's been followed this
far...by activating his orbiting climate
machines, he has flooded the abandoned
streets and buildings, to slow down our
heroes as he attempts to escape and
formulate his plans elsewhere! Naturally,
with a few skillful tricks up their
sleeves, Sonic and his pals won't miss a
beat in this drenched ghost town!

could never reach: the sky. But by hiking
up a range of mountains, Sonic is able to

You've come so far...don't let Eggman get
away now!

ruin in the middle of the desert. To get to
him, Sonic will not only have to contend
with Eggman's robots, but also the ancient
booby traps set up by the civilization that
once existed here. But hey, it's all in a
day's work, right?

a secret base in an old, abandonded mine...
or so he thinks. In fact, Sonic and company
followed him there...but they can't make
heads or tails of what Eggman is planning.
All they know is that whatever it is, it's
generating a lot of toxic slime and deadly
acid!

Eggman's rocket launching base. He seems
to be shipping some supplies to the planet
he took over. See if you can stow away on
Eggman's rocket undetected!

SceneText = Oh no! Eggman has decided that he cares
more about killing Sonic than delivering
the shipment, and bailed from the rocket
in an escape pod, leaving Sonic and his
friends stranded in space! But Tails has
calculated that Eggman can't get all the
way to his planet on that pod, and he must
therefore be flying to a second spaceship.
Sonic and his buddies will have to find
Eggman's other ship before it departs, or
they'll be stuck in deep space forever!

SceneText = Look at what Eggman has done to this once-
beautiful planet! Acid and fire and
scorched craters and sinister castles as
far as the eye can see! To add insult to
injury, the evil doctor has repurposed the
aliens' flying saucers as his war
machines! The aliens are counting on Sonic
to find and infiltrate Eggman's dark
fortress, stop his schemes, and save the
day. Is he up to the task? ...Sorry,
stupid question.

castle, but he's not done yet! Rather than
allow Sonic to liberate his alien slaves,
Eggman has flown to a nearby star and is
using its energy to power a Death Ray to
destroy the planet!

It all comes down to this. The final
showdown. Defeat Eggman now, and his plans
will be ruined! It's time to free the
Tortured Planet, save Mobius, and send
Eggman packing!

its humble beginnings. In its earliest
stages, the level pack was detested for a
variety of reasons. You are about to get a
glimpse of what Tortured Planet was like at
its inception. Much of it will look
familiar, but in a crude skeleton form.
