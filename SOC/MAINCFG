is indeed back...the alien planet to

who proved tragically easy to enslave. The

are going to have to search Sunshine Atoll
Zone from top to bottom in search of
Eggman, all the while dismantling his army
of Crawlas. There aren't a lot of natural
hazards in this tropical paradise, but it's
easy to get lost once you stray from the

in the jungle...

more trouble brewing! It seems that Eggman
is harnessing the energy of a magma hot
spot to power his factory. But this has
awakened a naturally dormant volcano which
is now spewing lava over a once-beautiful
plain! Sonic will have to shut down the
factory to save as much of the countryside
as he can.

in on the ruins of Eggman's former center of
operations, Dark City Zone. But Eggman is
not pleased that he's been followed this
far...by activating his orbiting climate
machines, he has flooded the abandoned
streets and buildings, to slow down our
heroes as he attempts to escape and
formulate his plans elsewhere! Naturally,
with a few skillful tricks up their
sleeves, Sonic and his pals won't miss a

You've come so far...don't let Eggman get

ruin in the middle of the desert. To get to
him, Sonic will not only have to contend
with Eggman's robots, but also the ancient

or so he thinks. In fact, Sonic and company
followed him there...but they can't make
heads or tails of what Eggman is planning.
All they know is that whatever it is, it's
generating a lot of toxic slime and deadly
acid!

more about killing Sonic than delivering
the shipment, and bailed from the rocket
in an escape pod, leaving Sonic and his
friends stranded in space! But Tails has
calculated that Eggman can't get all the
way to his planet on that pod, and he must
therefore be flying to a second spaceship.
Sonic and his buddies will have to find
Eggman's other ship before it departs, or
they'll be stuck in deep space forever!

beautiful planet! Acid and fire and
scorched craters and sinister castles as
far as the eye can see! To add insult to
injury, the evil doctor has repurposed the
aliens' flying saucers as his war
machines! The aliens are counting on Sonic
to find and infiltrate Eggman's dark
fortress, stop his schemes, and save the
day. Is he up to the task? ...Sorry,

It all comes down to this. The final
showdown. Defeat Eggman now, and his plans
