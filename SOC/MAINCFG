# Mod by Fawfulfan
# Credit goes to the
# Sonic Team Junior
# Developers, Megatal, and to
# the Leaf Forest Zone.

# Also to SpiritCrusher, who
# offered invaluable criticism
# and suggestions which allowed
# me to vastly improve this mod,
# Charybdizs, author of the music,
# Spherallic and D00D64, who allowed me to
# use their amazing custom textures,
# SonicX8000, who created some
# beautiful new sprites for the
# Blecch Bouncer, and Torgo, for
# fixing the LGZMESH1 flat.
